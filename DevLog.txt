Finaly got all the SFML files in order in the repository.
We have yet to test officially to see how using github is
going to work with colaborative coding.

Developing screens like a main menu and a screen for each
Level is going to prove more difficult than I had originaly
thought. Moving from one screen to another can be handled
either by the window or by the screen itself, but each
presents a disadvantage. If the window does it, it has
to poll the screen somehow to find out if it should switch
and to what it should switch. If the screen handles it,
there has to be some way for the baton from the window
to get passed to the next screen...
