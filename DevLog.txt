A log file for notes from developers Mose and Mohamed:

March 18 2016 -----------------Mose
Finaly got all the SFML files in order in the repository.
We have yet to test officially to see how using github is
going to work with colaborative coding.

Developing screens like a main menu and a screen for each
Level is going to prove more difficult than I had originaly
thought. Moving from one screen to another can be handled
either by the window or by the screen itself, but each
presents a disadvantage. If the window does it, it has
to poll the screen somehow to find out if it should switch
and to what it should switch. If the screen handles it,
there has to be some way for the baton from the window
to get passed to the next screen...

I think I found a solution to the screen issue. I settled
on using the screen as the primary controll for the window
using a form where each screen runs a finite but lengthly
loop. Within each loop, the screen may call another screen's
loop fucntion, effectively passing the baton of the window
to another stage. In this way, we can also controll what
menues are available where while simply backing back up
through menues by terminating their loops:

MainMenu
 L Select ship
 L Level Loop
    L Transition
    L Level1
       L PauseScreen
    L Transition
    L Level2
    L Shop
       L Sell
       L Buy
 L Credits

It might be important to make sure there's not a way for
and indefinite "tunneling" down menus that could result
in a memory crash, (Eg, using the pause menu to get to
the main menu as shown above would leave the whole level
1 sitting in the memory. This can be a problem in LOTS of
ways.)
